This project was inspired by a need for a way to track jobs and tasks at my place of work. The intended user will be people that are familiar with a computer as a tool but that have no desire to be a power user. The interface will be the absolute simplest way to input a job/task and get the results of a schedule..

I intend to build the simplest version of this and iterate to a more refined version over time. Further I intend to compile this in some way so that it functions as a normal desktop app. 

The language that I am using at this point is going to be Python since that is what I am familiar with and this will be good practise. At some point depending on the success of this project I might rewrite the software in another language.

I am going to stick to a simple text based storage method for my data since it will be very simple but ideally I can switch to a more standard type of database.
